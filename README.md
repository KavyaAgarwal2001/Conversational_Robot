# Conversational_Robot
Robotics club Summer Project
## Objective And Goal
The motive is to build an interactive robot that can be scoped to handle some real life problems ! 

The main aim is to build a conversational ChatBot that can take audio input ,convert the input audio into text ,generate meaningful response and then convert that text response into speech.
