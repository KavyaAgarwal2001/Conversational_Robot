truth behind the folklore', \"until the early 80's, most scientists had dismissed traditional aphrodisiacs as frauds\", 'but researchers are now finding that some do stimulate more than the imagination', 'one popular substance that has been eaten, sniffed and smoked all because of its reputed aphrodisiac properties is the bark of yohimbe a west african tree', 'a series of studies found that yohimbine, the active ingredient in yohimbe did raise erections in men by increasing blood flow to the penis', 'and with the yohimbe you wanna take vitamin c -1000 milligrams to help in case you have a nauseous feeling', 'it enhances the properties', 'oh, ok, whatever properties i can enhance, the better', 'they say on the box that it will take 8 hours to work', 'eight hours', '', 'so you have to brew it in the morning', 'and how long does it last just so i git my timing down', \"i bought some yohimbe in powdered form it's supposed to actually give you an erection for three days is what they say, uh you know i would have been happy with a couple of hours\", 'so i tried one form of it, a powdered form and basically', 'i just got sick you know i was nauseous for two hours', 'yohimbe works in several different ways', 'one of the ways is to increase circulation and the other way is to stimulate the nervous system', 'it does however have some downsides in that it can stimulate heart rate, raise blood pressure and can make one feel a little anxious, nervous and even a little nauseous, so that, sometimes that may not be the most desirable effect', 'that you want to have in an aphrodisiac', 'so despite its availability as a prescription drug,', 'yohimbine is not guaranteed to work and should only be used under the guidance of a physician', 'many of the herbal aphrodisiacs including yohimbine work by increasing blood flow to the genitals', \"when we're sexually stimulated by anything-physically mentally or chemically- the nervous system sends signals to the pelvic region the control center for the erection\", 'these signals prompt the blood vessels in the genitals to dilate, bringing in a rush of blood that inflates the erectile tissue', 'the veins then close, preventing blood from flowing out of the organ', 'the result... is an erection', 'one popular aphrodisiac is gingko', 'it comes from the leaves and nuts of the oldest family of trees- the gingko tree, and has been used in asia for centuries', 'schnitzy decided to give it a try', \"i drank this gingko tea, i'm not sure if it's a placebo effect or not but in my case i defimitely feel like gingko helped rush blood to critical parts of my anatomy which paid off with a fin air stewardess\", 'in the last 30 years, 300 studies have given clinical evidence that gingko can benefit the entire body in addition to having aphrodisiac qualities', 'a german study of men with erectile dysfunction found that gingko restored potency in half of them', 'but how does it work', 'ginkgo may work by stimulating the brain to release nitric oxide in the erectile tissue of both men and women', 'this causes the blood vessles to widen, more blood flows in and we have an erection', 'but the jury is still out on how safe and effective gingko is', \"it can have side effects such as headaches and shouldn't be taken with aspirin or by people suffering from heart disease\", 'hundreds of millions of

analysis shows that it contains substances similar to caffeine that can increase sensitivity in the genitals', 'it is also reputed to induce erotic dreams when drunk at bedtime, but damiana has not been approved by the fd a, so its effectiveness remains anecdotal', 'in asia, there are countless substances believed to have aphrodisiac properties', 'many of these make their way across the globe', 'one is a chinese herb called yin ya wo, otherwise known as horny goat weed', \"what's the deal with the horny goat weed here from china\", \"there's folklore information that says that chinese goat-herders noticed that their male goats were acting, in quotes, randy\", 'randier than goats', 'randier than the goats in other parts of the pasture and they found out they were eating a particular weed and the weed they named horny goats weed', 'and it worked for the chinese shepherds', 'well it worked for their goats i guess they started using it also', \"well, you know what i always say

works by severely irritating the urinary tract, sending a rush of blood to the genitals', 'today, spanish fly is illegal in the us and the fd a warns that it is a poison that can cause death, a high price to pay for better sex', 'but the quest for better sex is often costly', 'in asia, animal parts have been used for centuries', 'the testicles of bulls and rams were once eaten in the hopes of becoming more verile', \"and the phrase 'feeling horny' is said to come from the idea that animal head ornaments were considered aphrodisiacs\", 'powdered rhinoceros horns are still used in asia',

aphrodisiac ever since the mythological aphrodite was born from the sea', \"but some say there's more to 'sexy' foods than just folklore\", 'hot, spicy, sweet, juicy, words that make you wonder if someone is describing a great meal or a great lover', 'since the beginning of time food has been inextricably linked to our sexuality', 'historically mating rituals involved having a meal or banquet before sex and even today the act of eating is so linked to the act of lovemaking, that sex therapists sometimes prescribe a romantic meal for two, as an effective form of foreplay', 'maria, she loves to eat, so i mean there is something i know', 'i can be always giving her especially a good, i would say dinner', 'and then comes the romance and the sex is where, i can use that and then lure her in', 'frank and maria met in a chicago mall two and a half years ago and the chemistry was instant', 'maria works as a bookkeeper and frank drives a truck and for them, food is often the answer to keeping the flame alive', 'he loves whipped cream and so do i, and strawberries and syrup, oh, yes', \"so we try to make it interesting because you know sometimes if you just do the same thing all the time it just doesn't work\", 'but historically the lure of food as an aphrodisiac has had a lot more to it than the sharing of a romantic meal', 'we have historical books that tell us about the use of foods for example in the kama sutra, they describe a meal of eggs and onions with cardamom cinnamon, and nutmeg', 'if you have that before you meet your lover, your chances of having a better experience are greater', 'before science began exploring how our bodies work, people followed a premise known as the law of similarities', 'this dictated that what a food looked like determined how and where it could benefit the body', 'so if a food looked like genitalia it was bound to be an erotic stimulant', 'legend has it that the aztecs in ancient mexico were so impressed with the anatomical likeness of the avocado that they named the food ahuacatl or testicle, and forbade village maidens to set one virginal toe outside while the fruit was being harvested', 'many of the aphrodisiac foods were just thought to be aphrodisiacs because of their appearances like bananas asparagus, carrots because of their phallic appearance', \"but asparagus for example has very rich nutritional value, it has vitamin e, which is considered one of the sex hormone stimulants it's a vitamin that stimulates our hormonal production\", 'so it seems the ancients did get it right sometimes, because many of the foods that were considered aphrodisiacs actually have vitamins and minerals that are essential for a good sex life', 'one of the most visually suggestive love foods is the oyster', \"said by some to look like testicles when in the shell and by others to blatantly suggest a woman's anatomy,\", 'oysters are also a good natural source of zinc, a mineral necessary for the production of testosterone, believed to be the sex drive hormone in men and women', 'but, some argue that you would have to eat dozens of oysters for them to jump-start your libido', \"not all of the fabled foods' powers have to do with their vitamin and mineral content\", 'when it comes to being a hot-blooded lover, the chili pepper may hold the key', 'the spicy substance in hot foods called capsaicin causes nerve endings to release substance p, a neurotransmitter that stimulates a burning sensation', 'our pulse is raised and we sweat more just as we do during sex', 'some believe that eating hot foods can also trigger the release of endorphins, body chemicals that give us a natural high', \"and of course there is the ultimate lovers' gift -chocolate\", 'used for centuries as an aphrodisiac part of its lure comes from its sensuous melting quality', \"if you're talking about like sweets or something like that it would have to be like chocolate syrup\", \"you know because for

\"chocolate contains a substance called phenylethylamine which is a stimulant, it's considered the love chemical\", 'it gives one a sense of well being and excitement', \"and that's thought to be a chemical it's very similar to the endorphins that our body produces that give us that natural high\", \"some scientist believe this chemical in chocolate is broken down before it can 'turn us on', but

disliked it', 'how sexy you thought it was, how much you liked the way his kiss tasted, how much you desire to have another kiss from him', 'okay', 'we began to study using foods as aphrodisiacs because we found that when people lose their sense of smell or taste they develop sexual dysfunction', 'so the connection became apparent', 'almost 100 years ago, sigmund freud said that in order for us to remain a civilized society we had to repress our sense of smell, otherwise we would walk around sexually excited all the time', 'dr. hirsch has been testing this theory for over 10 years', 'up to 3,000 test subjects later he has found that certain food smells are so sexually exciting they actually increase penile and vaginal blood flow', 'when we inhale an aroma odor molecules enter the nose and stimulate small hairs called cilia to send messages to the brain', \"one part of the brain that receives these messages is the limbic system, often called the 'pleasure center'\", 'the signals then travel down to the spinal cord, and just like the food and herbal aphrodisiacs, cause blood to rush to the genitals', \"the food smells dr. hirsch's studies found to have the greatest effect, aren't exactly foods we associate with a night of passion\", \"of all the food smells he tested he found that pumpkin pie was the way to a man's libido increasing penile blood flow by 40%, buttered popcorn came second increasing blood flow by 9%\", 'and the most arousing smell for women was the licorice candy', 'good plenty', \"the curious thing hirsch's study found is that all smells actually arouse men to some degree\", 'women, who have a much more sensitive sense of smell, were more discerning', \"what we found was some odors inhibited female sexual arousal, for example the smell of cherries had a negative effect, the smell of barbecue roasting meat and the smell of men's cologne all acted to inhibit female sexual arousal\", \"despite dr. hirsch's studies, smell remains the most mysterious of all our senses and we are still not quite sure why these food smells affect our libidos\", 'but for maria and frank, the flavor and aroma defimitely enhanced the sensation', 'i

a little more, and then having to stop when they said stop', \"i'm like, oh, okay\", \"we can't do anything else\", 'vitamins, minerals and a delicious aroma may enhance a night of passion, but the secret to the ultimate aphrodisiac may lie within the body itself', 'the human body is forever surprising and delighting us', 'and aside from the obvious lures of beauty and seduction, the body itself has its own powerful aphrodisiacs', 'these come primarily in the form of two body chemicals- hormones and neurotransmitters', 'the hormones testosterone and estrogen are mainly secreted by the sex glands, which form part of the endocrine system', 'they are essential for our sex drives', 'some, neurotransmitters, like norepinephrine and dopamine are released primarily from the brain and send messages throughout our bodies', 'they trigger our sensations of pleasure and arousal', \"but when the body's natural love stimulants shut down, some people go in search of help\", 'mike albano, a

we look at the effects of stress on health and sexuality overall, stress is probably the most common cause of low libido', \"mike's lack of libido and general ill health began to have an impact on his 30-year marriage\", 'there was no communication, there was no closeness and stuff like that', \"performance weighed heavily on my mind, because i knew deep inside that i wasn't doing what i was supposed to be doing for my wife and for my lover\", 'and the desire was weaning, it was practically disappearing', 'when the body itself loses its own capacity to stir the libido, aphrodisiacs often become more of a necessity', 'determined to get his body up and running again, mike decided to try acupuncture', 'he put his trust in the hands of chinese herbalist and acupuncturist', 'adele

if he had low sex drive, and he said he did', \"it's a question i commonly ask because it gives me information about the person, about their overall energy level and from a chinese perspective their

blood flow', 'how you doing mike', 'great, totally relaxed', 'good', 'ok', 'by promoting circulation through the use of acupuncture you can help with sex drive because part of what has to happen is the area has to be infused with blood in order for normal sexual function to occur, both for men and women', 'according to mike, weekly sessions of acupuncture and a combination of chinese herbs including ginseng have helped put him back on track', 'from the very first session with adele, i brought a list of medications i was taking and she went through them all and she had told me that one of the specific medications', 'i was taking would have an adverse effect on my intimacy which i,', 'i totally was having', 'and she said one of the benefits of acupuncture that it it flows with

under our hair', 'we are surrounded by clouds of these molecules and leave trails of them as we walk', \"some of these signals smell some don't\", 'it is believed that they are picked up by the noses of other people, who are either consciously or unconsciously attracted to our smell', \"pheromones act in many ways for other animals as i guess what you'd call an aphrodisiac or at least as a sexual cue for an onset of sexual behavior\", 'they also do other things', 'there are alarm pheromones, there are mating pheromones, of course there are courtship type pheromones, there are weaning or suckling pheromones, so they act in many sorts of ways', 'whether or not a pheromone could act as an aphrodisiac in humans', 'i think is still a little bit of an open question', 'some studies show that there may be a link between pheromones and our sex drives', 'in one double blind experiment young women were exposed to either pheromones or a placebo', 'during the first three weeks of the test, 36 percent of those receiving the pheromones reported having weekly sex', 'by the fourteenth week the number doubled', \"and researchers say it wasn't just the power of suggestion, as the group exposed to the placebo experienced no change\", 'but, if pheromones are the source of chemistry between two people who are instantly attracted to each other without knowing why, the perfumes and scents humans can detect could also be considered powerful aphrodisiacs', 'some believe that smell is the sense most closely linked to our sexuality', 'although sight and touch are also essential to our sex drive, their signals must pass through areas of the brain known as the thalamus and the cortex before reaching the limbic lobe', 'aromas however, send signals directly to the limbic lobe provoking a more powerful emotional reaction', 'but what happens when we combine the lure of scent with the supposed power of pheromones', \"perfumes are now being used not only to enhance the fragrance of the wearer but since the early 90's, companies have cashed in on the idea that pheromones help sell products\", \"one success story is perceive, avon's new pheromone perfume\", 'out for

beautiful people in the world who will desire you and want you\", \"but in fact it'll attract anybody with a nose\", 'while research into the effectiveness of pheromones continues, there is one part of the body believed to be the center of it all', 'i think our brain is defimitely an aphrodisiac', 'so many things go into our sexual response-what we smell what we see, what we hear', \"our brain is

able to advise their patients and listeners on the latest libido enhancers,', 'greg and karen turned to exercise in their case, the eastern practice of tantra', 'tantra for us becomes an exercise of both mind and body', 'from the body standpoint, it helps us build the energy that we have, and it also helps us, release energy you know that goes into stress and it allows us to gain a relaxation and a joining then of each other', 'we think of it as building energy through breath through postures like yoga postures and that this energy that we build is part of our expression of loving of payingg attention to one another of increasing the joy and vitality in our love', 'there are two distinct ways to apply exercise to sexuality', 'the western approach is to emphasize the physical by spending hours on the treadmill or lifting weights', 'in the ancient cultures of the east however, it is more about the mind and body connection with a very strong focus on sex, so exercises such as yoga and tantra were developed', 'like some herbal aphrodisiacs tantra and yoga are said to help blood flow', 'in yoga there are many exercises that because of the particular posture they will stimulate blood flow to certain organs', 'and specific yoga exercises are geared towards improving the function of the ovaries the adrenal glands and the pituitary hypothalamus', \"and it's the relationship of these organs together that helps our sexual function flow smoothly\", 'aside from increasing blood flow to our sex glands, yoga also includes specific exercises that can be used to make sex better', 'some exercises help strengthen the muscles in the pelvic region, while others can help control orgasm and ejaculation', 'karen and greg practice tantra every week', 'and although science has yet to prove

often as a prelude to sex', 'indeed, dance often has the excitement, release and exhaustion characteristics of sexual climax', 'dance is defimitely an aphrodisiac', 'many of the latin dances for example are very sensual and very sexual', 'many of the rituals involved in mating in various different civilizations involved dance', 'for karen and greg, exercise has defimitely helped to enhance their sex lives, but sometimes, we need a prescription to perform', 'vast strides in medical technology have helped to make the issue of sexual performance a 21st century obsession', 'while our quest for the perfect aphrodisiac continues, have we replaced the potions of the past with the pharmaceuticals of the future', 'has the art of love become the art of science', 'in the united states it is

dysfunction and had to face the reality that medical assistance was needed', 'his doctor prescribed caverject- the first prescription medication approved by the fd a for erectile dysfunction', 'for greg, this meant having an injection before sex', 'caverject and penile injection therapy is not scary at all', \"because i'm the one who used to pass out just at the mere thought of getting a shot,

result - drugs ranging from estrogen rings to blood flow creams that enhance genital sensation are being developed at a frenzied pace', 'the best candidate for medication is a woman who was satisfied with her sexual response at one point in time, and now for whatever physical reason whether it be a pelvic surgery, or menopause or medication, is no longer able to respond as she once could', 'this

around the world reach menopause every year', 'with aging and menopause, women experience a variety of changes in their sexual function, being increased vaginal dryness increased pain with
